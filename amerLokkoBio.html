      <h2>My Likes</h2>
        <p2>I like to read and write fiction; I think it's fun to use my imagination and go on an adventure through reading.</p2>
        <p2>I love baking! I especially love to bake chocolate chip cookies. I also bake strawberry squares, brownies, and other sweet delicacies.</p2>
        <p2>I like to draw comic-style characters. I've been doing it for a long time, so I've gotten pretty good at it!</p2>
        <p2>I also loooooooooove cookie dough ice cream! If you get it for me for my birthday, I'll love you forever!</p2>

      <h2>Dislikes</h2>
        <p2>I don't like small, cramped places (like really small). I don't like the idea of not having enough personal space...especially if it's dark</p2>
        <p2>I do not like the direction our country is going; why start meaningless wars when the people of the U.S. (and the world for that matter) can be united in peace?</p2>

      <h2>My Talents</h2>
        <h3>Music</h3>
          <p2>I love music! So much so that I play three instruments: the piano, the clarinet, and the tenor saxophone. I started playing the
          piano when I was 7 years old, and although I stopped taking lessons since I started boarding school, I still like to come back to
          my keyboard to play some songs. I started playing the clarinet in 3rd grade, so when I was around 8 years old. I feel like I connect
          to the clarinet a lot; it is a subtle instrument, but it can also dominate the overall band's sound. I started playing the Tenor saxophone
          when I was in 7th grade, so around 12 years old. Since my band, at the time, did not have any more tenor sax players, the conductor asked the
          class if anyone wanted to play it in the band. I offered, and I haven't regretted my decision since.</p2>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
          <p2>I've been playing sports since I was little. The sports I've seriously done in my life were swimming, basketball, tennis, and track and field. I did swimming during my years at elementary school,
             but I stopped after that since I didn't feel that it was my forte. I played basketball since 3rd grade, and it was fun to play. I even played it in high school, but I didn't think I could keep up
             with all the constant back and forth during the games, so I decided to stop after my sophomore year. Tennis was also a fun sport to play, and I also played that until after my sophomore year in highschool.
             Track and field: now that's the sport I'm serious about. I've been sprinting since 3rd grade, when I first discovered my speed. Ever since then, my love for sprinting has increased ten-fold. I ran throughout
             middle school and continued it into highschool. My freshman year, I got a lot of first place medals, and I even made it to Junior Nationals. Unfortunately I couldn't attend, but if I could turn back time, I'd
             definitely go. I got injured in my sophomore year, unfortunately, and that slowed down my runing times a bit, but I got back up to speed last year, and I hope to get even faster during my senior year. I also go to the gym to train
            for the upcomming track seasons, so you can say that I love to stay in shape.</p>
